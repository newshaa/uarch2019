## Mission

The first Undergraduate Architecture (uArch) Mentoring Workshop is designed to familiarize late-stage undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students to research and career opportunities in the field of computer architecture in particular and graduate school lifestyle and survival skills in general. The program will include technical sessions that cover past, current and future research directions in computer architecture, mentoring sessions that cover how to apply to graduate school and how to navigate the architecture research landscape effectively, and networking sessions that create opportunities for students to interact with their peers and established architects in academia and industry. 

## Mechanics

The central theme of this workshop is to attract undergraduate students and early-stage graduate students who are interested in graduate school in computer architecture. To this end, uArch will likely include:
The Route to Graduate School: Students will learn how to apply to graduate school, how to find their research interests, how to talk with a potential advisor, etc.
* **Life at Graduate School**: The workshop will include keynote talks from academic and industry leaders about how to thrive at graduate school.
* **Computer Architecture Research Landscape**: The workshop will include technical sessions covering history, current state-of-the-art research and challenging problems that are left unsolved.
* **Meet an “Architect in Process’’**: As part of the workshop, attendees will be paired with students who are pursuing a Ph.D. degree in computer architecture to hear their first-hand experience about research and life at graduate school and build a mentor-mentee relationship.
* **Ask an Architect**: The workshop will include a panel of established architects in the industry and academia from whom students can seek career advice.
